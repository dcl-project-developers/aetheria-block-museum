Description: Nowadays, the majority of PoW chains are secured by large pool miners. If you have a GPU available and want to start mining, the only realistic solution is to join a mining pool and combine your efforts with that of many other miners in your situation. You then share the revenue based on your contribution to the pool hashrate.

This was not necessarily the case in the early days of Ethereum. There are multiple instances of miners who have only ever produced a single block: suggesting they were solo mining with their own GPU, before perhaps either ceasing to mine or moving onto a pool due to hashrate increases.

The CryptoArte in front of you is unique, because the miner shape you observe in its center is ever only visible once in the entire collection. This miner is a “one-time miner”, and in fact is the oldest of such. The account (see oneTimeMiner.aetheriablockmuseum.eth) mined the block #762. It was an empty block (no transactions), as were most blocks that early in the life of the blockchain. The solo-miner received 5.1625 ETH as a reward for mining the block, and 3.75 reward for including 1 uncle. There are no external or internal transactions associated with this account whatsoever; the 8.9 ETH is still sitting in the account to this day.
